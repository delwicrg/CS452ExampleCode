Our project successfully follows all of the guidelines assigned to us. We have produced a realistic scene in the form of a dining room. There are chairs, a table, cups, teapot, plates, a fireplace, plant, picture frame, and chandelier that come together to make a nice dining room scene. From this list, it can be noted that the project does have at least 3 distinct pieces. In fact, it has at least 9 objects (not counting duplicates). There are also at least 4 polyhedra in this scene. The user is able to interact with our cups and teapot using the transformations of rotations, translation, and scaling to manipulate them around the scene, including moving the pot in a way that mimics a pouring motion. There are also more than 2 lights in our scene. In particular, we have an ambient light, point light, and directional light source - meaning at least one creates a specular reflection. We also have more than 2 textures in this scene. Our table is textured to be a dark hardwood, and the fireplace is textured to be marbled. The smaller objects in the scene, such as the cups and cheese, are also textured to look as realistic as possible. 

This scene is displayed in a perspective projection, as required. We believe that the interactive controls are intuitive, and are described below: 


Lastly, we have provided this README that describes how we implemented our scene, and it is named README.txt.
